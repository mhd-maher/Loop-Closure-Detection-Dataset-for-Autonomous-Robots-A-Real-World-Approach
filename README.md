In our current era, due to the development of robots and the multiplicity of modern methods to find the best possible paths and identify them accurately. We must use information and databases that support these technologies. In this study, we present a challenging dataset of over 1000 images for different scenes in different locations within different environments, including parks, gyms, parking spaces, and some individual objects. These scenes were represented in five images for each scene and were captured using a mobile camera (HUAWEI NOVA 7I).
