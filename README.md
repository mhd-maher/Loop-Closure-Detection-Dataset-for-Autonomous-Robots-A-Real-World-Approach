In this repo , we present a challenging dataset of over 1000 images for different scenes in different locations within different environments, including parks, gyms, parking spaces, and some individual objects. These scenes were represented in five images for each scene and were captured using a mobile camera (HUAWEI NOVA 7I).

the dataset should have the next structure:

.
└── Dataset/
    ├── datastream_1/
    │   ├── samples/
    │   │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   │   ├── image3.jpg
    │   │   └── ..
    │   └── data_descriptor.csv
    └── datastream_2/
        └── data_descriptor.csv
